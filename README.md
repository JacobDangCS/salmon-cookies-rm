# gatsby-cookies

## Author: Jacob Dang & Trace Dugar

## Description
This project serves as a recreation of the Code 201 project 'Salmon Cookies' using a React framework 'Gatsby.js'. Considering how lightweight and relatively hard-coded the 201 project was, Gatsby felt appropriate to utilize due to the framework's capacity for quick performance and the ability to work with any data source such as Markdown.

## Process & Progress
In the progression of this application, we ran across a strange bug that wouldn't allow for live rendering of our application. Working with TA's and instructor Ryan, we concluded we had to scrap our entire application and start from scratch and send over files to the new Gatsby app. Given the limited amount of time we were hanging onto, we decided that it'd be more strategic to mock up the home page of the reference app for showcase.
