# gatsby-cookies

## Author: Jacob Dang & Trace Dugar

## Description
This project serves as a recreation of the Code 201 project 'Salmon Cookies' using a React framework 'Gatsby.js'. Considering how lightweight and relatively hard-coded the 201 project was, Gatsby felt appropriate to utilize due to the framework's capacity for quick performance and the ability to work with any data source such as Markdown.
